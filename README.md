# spaceheater

A ClojureScript Library for Litecoin mining. 

I originally wrote this library in JavaScript and it clocked in at a 
~~blazing~~ 1 hash per second. That means that you'll have about a
1/1x10^63 chance of winning. Great!

If mining Litecoins isn't really your style, then you're in luck. If you
let this library run its hashing algorithm in hundreds browser tabs at
once, then it can also serve as an efficient space heater for your room!

This library mostly exists as a side effect of playing around with bit
twiddling and the scrypt algorithm. There isn't any serious value in
it but enjoy!

## Usage
